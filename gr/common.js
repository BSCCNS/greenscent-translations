  "lesson1-intro-text": "Ο αέρας αποτελείται κυρίως από αέρια οξυγόνου και αζώτου, καθώς και άλλα αέρια σε μικρότερες ποσότητες, όπως οξείδια του αζώτου, οργανικές ενώσεις, όζον, διοξείδιο του θείου και αέρια θερμοκηπίου. Μικροσκοπικά σωματίδια υπάρχουν επίσης στον αέρα, που ονομάζονται αιωρούμενα σωματίδια.",
  "lesson2-intro-text": "Η σύνθεση του αέρα αλλάζει συνεχώς ανάλογα με την ώρα της ημέρας, τον καιρό, την εποχή και το υψόμετρο. Κάθε σωματίδιο που τροποποιεί τα φυσικά χαρακτηριστικά του αέρα ονομάζεται ρύπος. Η ατμοσφαιρική ρύπανση επηρεάζει τους ανθρώπους, τα ζώα και το περιβάλλον. Τα αυτοκίνητα, τα σπίτια, τα εργοστάσια, οι φάρμες και άλλες ανθρώπινες ή φυσικές πηγές μπορούν όλα να απελευθερώσουν ρύπους στον αέρα και να επιδεινώσουν την ποιότητα του αέρα.",
  "lesson3-intro-text": "Αν και μερικές φορές μπορούμε να δούμε σωματίδια που ρυπαίνουν τον αέρα, όπως τα μαύρα καυσαέρια, οι περισσότεροι ατμοσφαιρικοί ρύποι είναι τόσο μικροί που δεν μπορούμε να τους δούμε με γυμνό μάτι αλλά μόνο χρησιμοποιώντας μικροσκόπιο. Ακόμη και σε μια φαινομενικά καθαρή μέρα, η ποιότητα του αέρα μπορεί να είναι κακή, επηρεάζοντας την υγεία και το περιβάλλον μας.",
  "lesson4-intro-text": "Οι συνήθειές μας και οι καθημερινές μας δραστηριότητες επηρεάζουν το περιβάλλον στο οποίο ζούμε. Για παράδειγμα, τα εργοστάσια, τα οχήματα και ο καπνός του τσιγάρου απελευθερώνουν σωματίδια στον αέρα που είναι πολύ επιβλαβή για την υγεία μας. Αυτά τα σωματίδια ονομάζονται ανθρωπογενείς (ανθρωπογόνοι) ρύποι. Εκτός από τις ανθρώπινες δραστηριότητες, οι ατμοσφαιρικοί ρύποι μπορούν επίσης να προέρχονται από φυσικές πηγές, όπως καταιγίδες σκόνης και φυσικές καταστροφές.",
  "lesson5-intro-text": "Ο αέρας γύρω μας δεν είναι ποτέ σταθερός. Ακόμη και τις μέρες χωρίς αέρα, ο αέρας κινείται πάντα από το ένα μέρος στο άλλο. Η ατμοσφαιρική ρύπανση επίσης κινείται πάντα. Ο άνεμος, η βροχή και τα μοτίβα του αέρα στην ατμόσφαιρα βοηθούν στη μετακίνηση της ατμοσφαιρικής ρύπανσης σε όλο τον κόσμο. Ως εκ τούτου, ανεξάρτητα από το πού προέρχονται, οι ατμοσφαιρικοί ρύποι που εκπέμπονται σε μια χώρα μπορούν να ταξιδέψουν και να επηρεάσουν την ποιότητα του αέρα σε άλλες περιοχές.",

  "lesson8-intro-text": "Η ποιότητα του αέρα μπορεί να είναι καλύτερη ή χειρότερη σε διαφορετικούς δρόμους της ίδιας πόλης και μπορεί να αλλάξει γρήγορα ανάλογα με την ώρα της ημέρας. Αυτό εξαρτάται από την κίνηση των αυτοκινήτων και από άλλες πηγές ατμοσφαιρικών ρύπων (π.χ. βιομηχανικές περιοχές). Σε αυτό το μάθημα, εξερευνούμε τον δείκτη ποιότητας αέρα (AQI) στην πόλη της Βαρκελώνης, στην Ισπανία, που εμφανίζεται σε δύο διαφορετικές ώρες την ίδια μέρα. Στον χάρτη, θα δείτε πώς αλλάζει η ποιότητα του αέρα ανάλογα με την ώρα της ημέρας και το μέρος της πόλης.",
  "lesson9-intro-text": "Η ατμοσφαιρική ρύπανση είναι μια από τις κύριες αιτίες προβλημάτων στην υγεία μας αλλά και θανάτων σε όλο τον κόσμο. Ορισμένοι ατμοσφαιρικοί ρύποι υπάρχουν στον φυσικό κόσμο, όπως η σκόνη στις ερήμους ή η τέφρα σε ηφαιστειακές περιοχές. Οι άνθρωποι, ωστόσο, συμβάλλουν δραματικά στην ατμοσφαιρική ρύπανση με τις συνήθειες και τις καθημερινές τους δραστηριότητες.",
  "lesson10-intro-text":"Οι δραστηριότητες και οι καθημερινές μας συνήθειές είναι οι κύριες πηγές ατμοσφαιρικής ρύπανσης και λίγοι ρύποι προέρχονται από τη φύση. Ενώ δεν έχουμε κανέναν έλεγχο στις αμμοθύελλες ή τις ηφαιστειακές εκρήξεις, η αλλαγή των συνηθειών μας μπορεί να βοηθήσει πολύ! Είτε ζείτε σε ένα μικρό χωριό είτε σε μια μεγάλη πόλη, υπάρχουν μερικές απλές ενέργειες που μπορείτε να κάνετε για να μειώσετε τη ρύπανση.",
  "lesson11-intro-text":"Ενέργειες φιλικές προς το περιβάλλον, όπως το περπάτημα, το ποδήλατο και το σβήσιμο των φώτων, συμβάλλουν στη μείωση της ατμοσφαιρικής ρύπανσης. Ωστόσο, για να βελτιώσουμε την ποιότητα του αέρα που αναπνέουμε σε όλο τον κόσμο, πρέπει όλοι μαζί να εργαστούμε για μεγαλύτερες πράσινες δράσεις. Οι τοπικές δράσεις για τη μείωση της ατμοσφαιρικής ρύπανσης προστατεύουν όχι μόνο την υγεία των πολιτών σε μια συγκεκριμένη πόλη ή χώρα, αλλά επίσης αποτρέπουν την ατμοσφαιρική ρύπανση και τις επιβλαβείς επιπτώσεις της σε μακρινά μέρη.",

  "lesson1-discovercarousel-slide1": "Tiny particles floating in the air are known as particulate matter (or aerosols). They are released from human activities (e.g. cars) or natural sources (e.g. deserts). These particles include among others desert dust, pollen, liquid droplets, soot and smoke (e.g. from cigarettes or wildfires).",
  "lesson1-discovercarousel-slide2": "These particles are very small and cannot be seen with the naked eye. They come in different sizes, and are usually referred to as PM2.5 or PM10, which means particles that have a diameter under 2.5 or 10 micrometres, respectively.",
  "lesson1-discovercarousel-slide3": "Greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide and methane, are found naturally in the atmosphere. In a natural process known as the greenhouse effect, they trap the Sun’s heat reflected by the Earth, keeping our planet warmer and a comfortable place to live.",
  "lesson1-discovercarousel-slide4": "The right amount of greenhouse gases in the air is essential to our survival. However, human activities, such as using fossil fuels like oil and coal, are dramatically increasing the quantity of greenhouse gases, causing the Earth to warm more.",

  "lesson2-discovercarousel-slide2": "When the air is polluted, animals’ behaviour can also change. For example, birds sing less, bees abandon their hives, migration patterns change, and animals are less likely to procreate.",
  "lesson2-discovercarousel-slide3": "The environment is damaged also. Air pollutants can increase the acidity of land and water (acidification), cause an overload of nutrients in water leading to algal blooms and reduce vegetation growth. Air pollution can also change the colours and clarity of landscapes.",
  "lesson2-discovercarousel-slide4": "It is important to distinguish air pollutants that are toxic for human health from greenhouse gases, which trap heat from the sun and increase the planet’s temperature, leading to global warming.",

  "lesson5-discoverdropdown-3-desc": "The most active period for Saharan dust travelling across Europe is spring. When dust clouds form in the air, they worsen air quality, and can potentially cause respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.",
  "lesson5-discoverdropdown-4-desc": "The diffusion of Saharan dust across faraway regions of the Earth is the perfect example that pollution has no boundaries. For this reason, many countries are joining forces to protect the environment and public health.", 

  "lesson6-discovercarousel-slide1": "The AQI scale is divided into five categories: good (green), moderate (yellow), unhealthy for sensitive groups (orange), unhealthy (red), and extremely unhealthy (purple). The presence and amount of air pollutants changes during the day.",
  "lesson6-discovercarousel-slide2": "When the air contains very small quantities of pollutants, the air quality is good, so the AQI shows a green colour. On the contrary, when there are high quantities of pollutants in the air, the air quality is really bad and the AQI shows a purple colour.",
  "lesson6-discovercarousel-slide3": "The air is mostly clean when there are very few pollutants: there is no risk when we breathe or do outdoor activities. On the contrary, when there are many pollutants in the air it’s not clean: our health is at risk and we should avoid outdoor activities.",
  "lesson6-discovercarousel-slide4": "AQI is particularly useful for citizens and governments. By using the AQI, we can know the condition of the air and the environment. Citizens and governments can then take measures to protect their health.",

  "lesson9-discoverdropdown-2-desc": "Exposure to air pollutants can be last for a short time, for example during a day with a lot of pollution, or for a long time (known as chronic), when living for years in a place with polluted air. Chronic exposure to air pollution is worse for our health.",
  "lesson9-discoverdropdown-3-desc": "With short-term exposure, air pollutants can irritate our eyes, nose, throat and skin, and cause allergies, asthma attacks and respiratory infections. In the long term, they can affect our lung and heart function, causing strokes, heart diseases and lung problems.",
  "lesson9-discoverdropdown-4-desc": "Both healthy people and those with pre-existing health conditions can suffer from health problems caused by air pollution. Young children, pregnant women and old people are generally more sensitive to air pollutants.",
